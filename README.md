```

## What Makes This Different

Traditional LLM training requires massive computational resources and direct model weight adjustments. Our approach introduces a compilation layer that transforms conventional training patterns into optimized prompt systems.

### The Compilation Advantage

## üéì Training Tutorial

### 1. Understanding the Architecture

The system uses a multi-layered approach to poker decision making:
```python
class PokerAgent(dspy.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        self.hand_evaluator = HandEvaluator()
        self.opponent_model = OpponentModel()
        self.position_strategy = PositionStrategy()
```

### 2. Configuring Training Parameters

Optimize your training with custom configurations:
```python
config = TrainingConfig(
    num_epochs=1000,
    batch_size=32,
    learning_rate=0.001,
    validation_interval=50,
    patience=10,
    temperature=0.7
)
```

### 3. Data Generation & Augmentation

Create diverse training scenarios:
```python
def prepare_training_data():
    # Generate balanced hand distributions
    # Create multi-street scenarios
    # Vary stack sizes and positions
    return train_data, valid_data
```

## üõ† Advanced Customization

### Custom Evaluation Metrics
```python
class CustomEvaluator(PokerEvaluator):
    def __init__(self):
        self.metrics.extend([
            "fold_equity",
            "range_advantage",
            "stack_leverage"
        ])
```

### Opponent Modeling
```python
class OpponentModel:
    def analyze_opponent(self, history):
        # Pattern recognition
        # Tendency analysis
        # Exploit identification
```

## üìä Performance Optimization

param_grid = {
    'learning_rate': [0.001, 0.01, 0.1],
    'batch_size': [16, 32, 64],
    'temperature': [0.5, 0.7, 0.9]
