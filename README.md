## üéì Training Tutorial

### 1. Understanding the Architecture

The system uses a multi-layered approach to poker decision making:
```python
class PokerAgent(dspy.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        self.hand_evaluator = HandEvaluator()
        self.opponent_model = OpponentModel()
        self.position_strategy = PositionStrategy()
```

### 2. Configuring Training Parameters

Optimize your training with custom configurations:
```python
config = TrainingConfig(
    num_epochs=1000,
    batch_size=32,
    learning_rate=0.001,
    validation_interval=50,
    patience=10,
    temperature=0.7
)
```

### 3. Data Generation & Augmentation

Create diverse training scenarios:
```python
def prepare_training_data():
    # Generate balanced hand distributions
    # Create multi-street scenarios
    # Vary stack sizes and positions
    return train_data, valid_data
```

## üõ† Advanced Customization

        self.metrics.extend([
            "fold_equity",
            "range_advantage",
            "stack_leverage"
        ])
```

### Opponent Modeling
```python
class OpponentModel:
    def analyze_opponent(self, history):
        # Pattern recognition
        # Tendency analysis
        # Exploit identification
```
