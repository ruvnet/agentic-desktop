## User Guide

### Getting Started

1. **Installation**
```bash
pip install poker-bot
```

2. **Basic Usage**
```python
from poker_bot import PokerAssistant

assistant = PokerAssistant()
advice = assistant.get_action(
    hand="AH KH",
    position="BTN",
    pot_size=100,
    stack_size=1000
)
```

3. **Configuration**
```python
config = TrainingConfig(
    temperature=0.7,  # More creative play
    num_simulations=1000  # Higher accuracy
)
```

### Game Modes

#### 1. Cash Game Mode
- Optimized for deep-stack play
- Focus on long-term EV
- Adjustable risk parameters
```python
assistant.set_game_type('cash')
assistant.set_stack_depth('deep')  # 100BB+
```

#### 2. Tournament Mode
- ICM-aware decisions
- Stack preservation focus
- Bubble factor consideration
```python
assistant.set_game_type('tournament')
assistant.set_stage('bubble')  # Near money
```

### Strategy Customization

#### 1. Playing Style
```python

```

#### 2. Position Adjustment
The bot automatically adjusts strategy based on position:
- BTN (Button): Most aggressive
- CO (Cutoff): Aggressive
- MP (Middle Position): Balanced
- UTG (Under the Gun): Conservative
- BB (Big Blind): Defense-oriented
- SB (Small Blind): Selective

#### 3. Stack Size Adaptation
```python
# Short stack mode (<30BB)
